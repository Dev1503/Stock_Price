# Stock Price Prediction

This is a classic implementation of Time Series Forecasting, to predict stock prices.
Here, the closing price of ADANIPORTS.NSE stock for each trading session has been predicted.
The  prediction has been projected as a trend line rather than a predicted continuation to the closing price graph.
Two models have been used namely:
 - Auto-Regressive Model
 - Moving-Average Model (ARIMA).
